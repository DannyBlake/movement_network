## Musculoskeletal Network Experimentation in R

Just a notebook to do some experimentation in R for the construction and analysis of anatomical / musculoskeletal networks.

Learning to use R for graph analysis through the book:
Højsgaard, Søren; Edwards, David; Lauritzen, Steffen (2012-02-22). Graphical Models with R (Use R!) (Kindle Location 292). Springer New York.


```{r load packages}
library(gRbase)
library(Rgraphviz)
```

## Load Upper Extremity Anatomical Network

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ue_am<-read.csv("AdultForeLimb.csv",row.names = 1, header= TRUE)
ue_am<-as.matrix(ue_am)
ue_network<-as(ue_am, "graphNEL")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
